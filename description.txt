Using the data that was just released this year by the CDC on yearly incidents of cancer, this project will load the data, and do an analysis of which states have shown an increase or decrease in cancer incidents from 1999 -2010. This analysis can be broken down by many factors, including age group, race and cancer site. I plan on providing a graph of incidents of cancer via a Dorlang Cartogram (idea taken from "21 Ways to Mine Twitter", last chapter).

My plan is to extract the data in Python and store the data in pandas. Using this, the program should be able to query the data frame for any data it needs to complete the analysis, and output this to a file. Another script / function can generate the cartogram and also store this to disk.
